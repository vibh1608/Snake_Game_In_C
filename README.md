# Snake_Game_In_C

This game contains one white colored object which is under user control and runs over the screen, and we need to touch the target object, which is in red color with out touching the border lines.
          I used <graphics.h> library function to apply graphics in this program. I have already decided the number of rows and columns in which the snake can move. I have included ‘gotoxy’ function to move cursor on various points which are allowed and defined.
          With the advantage of graphics library, I have given the commands to pause(<p>),start(<s>), exit(<esc>) etc… to directly apply commands. Snake will be of white coloured to differ from black screen.
I have also provided red coloured food for snake in various moments in game. When snake eats this red coloured food , it’s size will increase. And to terminate the game, if snake touches the border allowed rows and columns, game will be automatically over. When game terminates, I have set command <Enter> to play game again. I have given particular conditions that if player scores greater than some specific score, computer appreciate saying,”you have scored well,keep it up”
And if user fails to cross that score then it will say,” sorry,better luck next time”.
            I will make various functions to conduct various movements on various paths. And if snake touches border, function will automatically terminate and game will be over. I will also give function to randomize the game such that every time, snake will not enter from the same place. It will change it’s place of entering the screen randomly. For playing game, player can use four arrow keys on the keyboard. When snake anywhere will touch the border, it’s colour will change from that player can understand that game is over.

Output is verified on Turbo c++ screen.
